            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I hope you are doing well.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Brown University with a Master of Science in Computer Science in May 2024 and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics-Computer Science in May 2023.</p>
            <p>My primary professional expertise lies in backend software engineering, particularly in databases, networking, and low-latency systems.</p>
            <p>I am most passionate about cosmology. Studying the history, structure, and future of our universe is something I never tire of, and it continually deepens my appreciation for the natural world around us.</p>
            <p>I enjoy hiking, camping, chess, and visiting museums. I am an avid reader, particularly of history, science fiction, and current events. I love watching the Champions and Premier League, as well as playing soccer.</p>
